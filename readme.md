# KOTYARA library

> this library is under initial development

Kotyara is an attempt to provide simpler and more kotlin-style database interface than other systems.

The idea is to let the same agility that provides scala anorm library without precompiling SQL as sqldelight does, lieaving all database logic conveniently put together in the kotlin source files.

It also has built-in support for different read and write connections for heavy loaded data systems with write-master/read-slaves db setups.

It is not yet ready for any evaluation.
